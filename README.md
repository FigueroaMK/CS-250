How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
I think so far my way of interpretting user needs and implementing them has been to interpret and fill in the details that are not so clear from when they were gathered. I think the 'user stories' is a good way to not only organize them and keep all details together but to classify them so that they can be priotitized to work on them. 


How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future developmant work?
My usual approach to developing programs is to work in small steps until the project is completed. From the Agile processes I would like to incorporate the sprint set up, working on small task and reviewing my work and set up before moving on to the next iteration. 


What does it mean to be good team member in software development?
I think the best way to be a good team meber in software development is to actively participate every step of the way. Ask questions, raise concerns and write comments along the any code you write.
